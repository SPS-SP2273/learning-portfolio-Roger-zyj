    "1. What is a git **repository**?\n",
    "    To answer the question, we must first know what is a repository. A repository is a centralised location where data is stored and managed. What about a git? A git is a kind of version control system that keeps track of changes made to a file over time. So a git repository is a centralised data storage location that has the ability to keep track of changes in the files over time.\n",
    "2. Git keeps tracks of ____changes____ in the files in our repository.\n",
    "3. What is a commit?\n",
    "    A commit is like a \"save\" button on your local drive. After making some changes to your file, you ask yourself, \"do I really like these changes? Do I really want to **commit** to my decisions?\"\n",
    "4. What is a push?\n",
    "    A push is like the \"submit\" button on Canvas when you're submitting an assignment. After you commit to a change on your local drive, you have only changed the files on your local drive, you haven't actually made any changes to the files in the repository. You need to **push** your changes into the centralised repository whom everyone else working on the project is connected to.\n",
    "5. What is a pull?\n",
    "    A pull is like a \"download\" button on Canvas when you're downloading the professor's lecture slides. After you've pushed your changes into the repository, you'd want to make a \"pull request\": you wanna **request** for your teammates to **pull** the changes that you've made, from the repository into their own local drives.\n",
    "6. What is the difference between GitHub and GitHub Desktop?\n",
    "   I actually have no clue... I always thought that GitHub Desktop is just an app you run on your desktop with a prettier GUI than working with GitHub on your browser... Is there actually a difference between the two?\n"
