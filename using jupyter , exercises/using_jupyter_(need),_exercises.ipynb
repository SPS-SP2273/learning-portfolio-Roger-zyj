    "1. What is a git **repository**?\n",
    "    To answer the question, we must first know what is a repository. A repository is a centralised location where data is stored and managed. What about a git? A git is a kind of version control system that keeps track of changes made to a file over time. So a git repository is a centralised data storage location that has the ability to keep track of changes in the files over time.\n",
    "2. Git keeps tracks of ____changes____ in the files in our repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before I go on to explain commit, push, pull, and pull requests, I think it's best to lay out the structure of the whole system.\n",
    "    There are 3 places where files can exist on. Your working directory (where you directly make changes to your files), your local repository (where the finalised changes to your files are living), and the remote repository (The centralised data storage location that the public has access to). The remote reository is where the main branch (the currently best and most publically affirmed version) of the project lives.\n",
    "3. What is a commit?\n",
    "    A commit when you move changes from your working directory to your local repository. After making some changes to your file in your code editor, you ask yourself, \"do I really like these changes? Do I really want to **commit** to my decisions?\" If the answer is yes, then these changes will be recorded and stored in the local repository. If the answer is no, then there is no need to painfully officially record down all the changes you're experimenting with, so the changes are restricted to your working directory.\n",
    "4. What is a push?\n",
    "    A push is like the \"submit\" button on Canvas when you're submitting an assignment. After you commit to a change on your local repository, you have only changed the files on your local drive, you haven't actually made any changes to the files in the remote repository that the public has access to. You need to **push** your changes into the remote repository. Another use of a push could be, when you want to push a change made in a side branch onto the main branch.\n",
    "5. What is a pull?\n",
    "    Let's say you are now the owner of the main branch in the remote repository. Some other dude wrote some code in a smaller side branch which you think is actually pretty good. Instead of the dude pushing his changes into the main branch, the agency could lie on you: you could be the one to **pull** the changes from the side branch into the main branch. In so doing, you would be merging features from the side branch into the main branch.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    What is a pull request?\n",
    "    As the ownder of the main branch on the remote repository, you usually don't want to grant permission for every arbitrary person to be able to push changes onto the main branch: some random-ass dude could be trying to push some bad changes into your code and ruining your project. Therefore, instead of allowing this dude to **push** into the main branch, you only allow yourself to **pull** his changes into the main branch, at your own discretion. So when the dude is hoping that you'd pull those changes into the main branch, he makes a **request** for you to **pull**. Hence **pull request**.\n",
    "6. What is the difference between GitHub and GitHub Desktop?\n",
    "   I actually have no clue... I always thought that GitHub Desktop is just an app you run on your desktop with a prettier GUI than working with GitHub on your browser... Is there actually a difference between the two?\n"
